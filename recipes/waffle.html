        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Protein Waffles made using a blend of whey and casein proteins with oat flour. These are great when batched prepped and stored in the freezer for an easy breakfast or snack in minutes. Top them with berries, chocolate chips, or eat them plain.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 scoops (125 g) vanilla whey protein</li>
            <li>4 scoops (125 g) vanilla casein protein</li>
            <li>1⅔ cups (200 g) oat flour ⁣⁣</li>
            <li>¾ cup (100 g) cornstarch or tapioca flour</li>
            <li>2½ tsp (10 g) baking powder ⁣⁣</li>
            <li>2½ cups (600 g) liquid egg whites⁣⁣ or whole eggs, just match the weights</li>
            <li>3⅓ cups (750 g) plain nonfat Greek yogurt ⁣⁣</li>
            <li>1 cup (240 g) water ⁣⁣</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix all the dry ingredients together so no clumps are present. NOTE: I have tested this with only whey protein and it doesn't turn out. Only casein will work but you may need more water in the batter. The 50/50 blend of protein is best.</li>
            <li>Add in the wet ingredients and mix thoroughly. The amount of water required may be variable. You need the batter to be pourable but not too watery. As the batter sits while you cook your waffles, the casein and oat flour will hydrate more and thicken the batter. You may need to add more water as you go.</li>
            <li>Heat your waffle iron and spray with oil. Add the batter and cook for a 3-5 minutes or until browned and set. The waffle iron I use is an 8×8" square. I use between 200g-230g of batter per waffle.</li>
            <li>Continue working your way through the batter until all of it has been used up and your waffles are cooked. As your waffles come out of the iron, allow them to cool on a wire lined sheet pan. If you have a square waffle iron like mine, cut the waffles into the 4 individual waffles.</li>
